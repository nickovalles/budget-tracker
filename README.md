## Description

Users need a fast and easy way to track their money, but allowing them to access that information at any time is important. Having offline functionality is paramount to the success of an application that handles usersâ€™ financial information.

This week I created a budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total should be updated when they're brought back online. 

## Usage
